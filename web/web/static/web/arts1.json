POINT O.C., D.F.A., D.Litt., RCA, (1952 - )&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Susan A. Point</strong> is a Musqueam First Nation artist in Vancouver, British Columbia. Since childhood Susan\u2019s been taught the customary values of her culture and traditions of her people by her many aunts and uncles, but above all by her late mother, Edna Grant- Point, and her late uncle, Dominic Point.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Susan\u2019s artistic career began January 1981, designing and creating gold &amp; silver jewellery. At this time, Coast Salish art was an almost lost art form (due to European colonists) therefore much of the native artwork produced and sold through various galleries and museums consisted of northern First Nations art, which was made readily available. Enthusiastic to understand more about her own peoples art style, Susan chose to concentrate on the traditional designs and elements created by her ancestral artisans.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Through research and consultation (both in Canada and the U.S.), Susan began her study on the design and art style of traditional Coast Salish artifacts. Susan then began representing \u201call\u201d of her Coast Salish peoples creating designs reflecting traditional images of the past in jewellery, limited edition serigraphs, and paintings. Ironically, although Susan researched to understand the art style of her ancestors, her very first two-dimensional image using the silkscreen process was a \u201ccontemporary\u201d print entitled \u201cSalmon\u201d.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Over the past 3 decades, Susan has been instrumental in re-establishing Coast Salish art both in Canada and the United States \u2026 drawing inspiration from the images of her ancestors and commencing the use of non-traditional materials and techniques in paper, glass, precious metals, wood, concrete, polymer, stainless steel, and ductile iron; inspiring a whole new generation of Northwest Coast artists. Susan\u2019s biggest reward has been her many opportunities to meet elders and teachers from other communities around the world, and to see the emergence in contemporary Coast Salish artists.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As a result of Susan\u2019s willingness, drive, and love of experimentation, she has been awarded numerous public art commissions including building facades and large sculptures in Canada and the U.S. These large scale works welcome visitors as well as honour the native peoples that once inhabited these lands. Susan also has private collections worldwide as well as various museums.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>For Susan\u2019s dedication, in reviving traditional Coast Salish art, which is unique to the Natives living on the Salish Sea, she has been appointed an officer of the Order of Canada, presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, in addition to an Indspire Achievement Award, a YWCA Woman of Distinction Award, a B.C.

She assisted one through conducting an Aboriginal Artists Survey and having it analyzed by David Try, consultant while assisting him with a Needs Assessment for the group.  She also assisted the Urban Aboriginal Artists Collective in applying for an internship opportunity in 2012 which involves a tool making project for Aboriginal youth.

I have always worked within the elements of traditional southern Kwakiutl art, and it has taken me years to broaden my artistic creativity. For instance, I have finished my first bronze casting, which is something relatively new to me - working in this medium.</p><p align=\"left\">My art work crosses the continuum of history and the present. I enjoy being able to share our culture with the world, and I feel very fortunate to have the capacity to pass on our Elders&rsquo; teachings. Most importantly, it is a way for us to teach our children, our &ldquo;Gwa&rsquo;layu&rdquo;, (our reason for living) by providing a creative, inspiring environment that generates knowledge of their crests, legends, songs and dances, giving them a sound foundation of their identity.</p><p align=\"left\">As I work within the traditional Northwest Coast Kwagu&rsquo;l style, I am reminded of the diversity, spirituality, transformation and meaning of our Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw culture. The subject, design elements and colors are elements that contribute to my inspiration. I most enjoy working with western red cedar, and am particularly interested in carving poles. When I create these sometimes monumental pieces, I begin by envisioning who the pole is for, who or what it will stand for, and where it will stand. There are certain elements that represent the unifying symbolism of various animals and legends which I follow through the knowledge and teachings of my Chiefs, Elders and artists.&quot;</p><p align=\"left\">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>", "node_id": 1258}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-127.410378, 50.694093]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"type": "artist", "name": "Sharifah Marsden", "details": "<p>Sharifah is an Anishnabe artist from the Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation.

Trevor started working with media, editing, and film when he was only in elementary school. He created video game &lsquo;montages&rsquo; and uploaded them to the internet where they received millions of views from around the world. He helped form a freelance video editing, motion graphics and videography group called &lsquo;Viral Design&rsquo; and was flown across North America to produce product promotional videos for companies such as Red Bull, Steelseries and Gunnar Optiks. After moving to Vancouver in 2011 Trevor was accepted into Capilano University&rsquo;s &lsquo;Motion Picture Arts&rsquo; program where he completed his first year and later moved into the &lsquo;Indigenous Independent Digital Filmmaking&rsquo; program. In 2011 Trevor created a short PSA video called &lsquo;Get Up, Move Up&rsquo; for the First Nations Health Council &lsquo;Active Spirit, Active History&rsquo; film contest and won the $5,000 grand prize. He also placed fifth in the Red Bull Crashed Ice qualifiers in Vancouver and later placed 76th out of 300 in the Red Bull Crashed Ice World Championships in Quebec City, Quebec. The next year he placed second in the First Nations Health Council&rsquo;s &lsquo;Safer Nations&rsquo; video contest. Since then he has worked as a contract videographer creating videos such as documentaries, PSAs, and promotional videos for companies and organizations such as Provincial Health Services Authority, Interior Health, and Thompson Rivers University.</span></p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 16px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; outline: none; border: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 20px;\">Trevor recently finished production on his first short film titled &lsquo;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asRvvNtbBY4&amp;list=FLosc2d1flfGDY_QhCoeHsIQ\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; outline: none; background-color: transparent; border: none; cursor: pointer; color: rgb(18, 59, 92);\" target=\"_blank\">The Blanketing</a>&lsquo; which is about a confrontation between the Tsilhqot&rsquo;in people and two&nbsp;road builders.&nbsp;The film has been accepted into many festivals around the world including the Toronto Independent Film Festival, the imagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival, the Square Pegs IV Film Festival, Red Nation Film Festival and many others.</p>", "node_id": 1292}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-123.14597, 51.99129]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"type": "artist", "name": "Jesse McMann-Sparvier", "details": "<p><font size=\"2\">A Cree from Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan, Jesse has been hoop dancing for 9 years, and while ze is known for the dance work, Jesse is also a musician, trained at the University of Calgary and University of Manitoba.&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently Jesse is working on creating a body of work that focuses on the body as a source for creation and relation to the earth.

Winadzi is from the Kwakwaka&rsquo;wakw nation, most specifically from the <strong>Kwicksuteniuk</strong> clan from Gilford Island. Raised in Campbell River, Simon worked in the commercial fishing industry for almost 20 years. When he reached the age of 15 he decided to start carving cedar and trained under his father, a renowned artist in his own style.&nbsp; After leaving Campbell River, Winadzi attended &lsquo;The Vancouver Film School&rsquo; from 1996-1998. He finished both 2D classical and 3D computer animation and created a short student film called &ldquo;Dawn of Creation&rdquo; which was the inspiration for Raven Tales &ldquo;How Raven Stole the Sun&rdquo;. Simon has been working with National Geographic All Roads since 2004 being the first recipient of the National Geographic All Roads Film Grant for Raven Tales. Simon practiced his carving for several years while living in North Vancouver and was asked to carve 3 totem poles for Fukushima Japan in 2001. He worked for several galleries in North America and participated in several art shows over the years. Now living on Bowen Island with his wife Naomi James, &nbsp;Winadzi has completed 26 episode of &lsquo;Raven Tales&rsquo; and is the proud owner of &lsquo;Raven Tales Production Corp&rsquo; since 2004. Simon has collaborated on public art projects with artists on Bowen Island including a sculpture called &ldquo;Embracing the Spirit of the Flame&rdquo;. This project started on the day that the Olympic Flame came to Bowen Island on its way to the Opening Ceremonies for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. In May of 2011 Simon collaborated in creating a carved cedar panel with students from Kindergarten to grade 5 for the Bowen Island Community School.

In all facets, from beginning to end. From script writing, to producing, acting, directing, marketing, world-wide partnerships, film festivals, distribution, etc. By using Indigenous lands to make movies will create jobs. If Aboriginal communities were able to access a fund that would provide tax credits to movie makers on top<span class=\"text_exposed_show\"> of existing tax credits available, then, it would mean more jobs. Making movies can be very rewarding, we tell our stories, we educate people of our beliefs and history, etc. I support the creation of an Indigenous Film Commission and I am hoping that the Federal Government, Nation States, Provinces, etc. will contribute to a Trust fund established for this purpose. To make this happen, political support is required.<br /><br />The goal is to promote media arts &amp; film making within Indigenous communities, to promote partnerships with established film makers, to make use of Indigenous lands, and for eligible film projects to be topped-up with not just currently existing film tax credits but with an additional tax credit available through an International Indigenous Film Commission.<br /><br />An infusion of funds to some sort of Trust would be a good start and is essential. This would create a huge incentive for film makers to consider Indian Reserves as locations for movie making which will result in direct benefits such as training, jobs, economic development and increased tourism.<br /><br />While there are existing national, provincial and regional film commissions, I am not aware of any that have a specific mandate and full jurisdiction to work directly within Aboriginal communities. In Canada, Indian Reserves are Federal jurisdiction, so it&rsquo;s not in the best interests of Provincial and Regional film commissions to promote Indian Reserves as locations for shooting feature films.<br /><br />I would like to see, hopefully in Vancouver or Toronto, a 2013 conference to establish an International Indigenous Film Commission or at the very least, a National Aboriginal Film Commission.<br /><br />It is going to take political action to make this film commission happen. Elected officials and those who represent Indigenous peoples at all forums, please consider this request. Political resolutions are requested to put this idea on the agenda within the various political bodies, please assist in making this idea become a reality.<br /><br />Any help in moving this dialogue forward is much appreciated.

She is of Haida descent from her mother&rsquo;s side and is of the Naa S&#39;aagaas Xaaydagaay Eagle clan. Spending most her childhood in Skidegate, Raven grew up with the beautiful environment surrounding her home which inspired her growing imagination. At an early age she began drawing animals inspired by animations such as Disney, Don Bluth, and various Japanese animation companies. Her beginnings in Haida Art first took root at the age of 13, when she was asked to participate in a Haida dance blanket project lead by Yolanda Skelton. During the summer break Raven created two Haida blankets, one for the Skidegate youth dance group and the other for her. In 2006 Raven and her family moved to Fort St. John and she enrolled in North Peace Secondary. During her time there she took classes in computer animation, art foundations, painting, and musical theater. She graduated in 2009 and moved back to Haida Gwaii to start an apprenticeship with her uncle and Haida carver, Robin Rorick. He taught her the basic principles of Haida design and painting skills and helped her complete 3 Haida drums. After her time with Robin, Raven began to work with Ben Davidson, the son of renowned master carver, Robert Davidson. &nbsp;Under the teaching of Ben her art form was taken to the next level, with more complex and intricate designs. In 2012 Raven made the choice to enroll into Emily Carr University of Art + Design to pursue a Bachelors in Fine Arts. After completing two years she decided to put her studies on hold to go back to a traditional art form and learn carving at the Freda Diesing School of Northwest Coast Art. She currently resides in Terrace and has begun her first year of the First Nation Fine Arts Program and is eager to start a new journey in her artistic practice. During her summer break from her studies she returns back to Haida Gwaii and works at the Haida Heritage Centre and Haida Gwaii Museum. In the past two years she has had the positions of cultural interpreter and collections assistant and enjoys educating the public about Haida traditions and stories. She is also part of the Haida Dance Group, Hltaaxuulang Guud Ad K&#39;aaju, which translates to &ldquo;Friends Singing Together&rdquo;.

In recent years, Cecil has been working closely with master carver, Tim Paul.&nbsp;<br /><br />Culture is incredibly important to Cecil. He started carving by building up various families&rsquo; regalia, by replicating what was stolen or lost during the potlatch ban. Since then Cecil&rsquo;s personal goal has been to revitalize and preserve the First Nations culture. Cecil has a strong sense of propriety and will not copy from a book. His pieces are unique and to his own style, demonstrating a deeply rooted understanding of his culture.<br /><br />Cecil attended the Kootenay School of Art in Nelson, B.C.

Do not leave it the way you found it because it is a living, breathing thing that needs to grow&quot;. Cecil recalls that when his grandmother spoke about the art, she was speaking about the people.<br /><br />Cecil&rsquo;s maturity as an artist is blossoming through the motion of retelling stories in various mediums.

At the ripe age of 11, his grandfather gave him the best gift any young child could ask for: A 1941 &ldquo;National New Yorker&rdquo; Archtop Electric Guitar. The guitar was played endlessly by Jacobs&rsquo; grandfather, an accomplished jazz musician. From the second that the young Scott Jacobs plugged in that guitar and strummed his first chord, he was hooked. </span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:AppleSystemUIFont\"><span style=\"color:#353535\">When Jacobs left his hometown at the age of 18, there was no doubt in anyone&rsquo;s mind that music is what he was born to do, and simply no other career would suit him. A week after his 19th birthday, he was on the other side of the world, living on a boat, and working as a musician for a cruise line. He would go on to perform for various cruise lines for a few years, during this time performing as a guitarist, and as a piano bar entertainer. Although these early gigs would wet his appetite for performing, and prepare him for life as a traveling musician, he quickly realized this is not what he wanted to do with his life. He wanted to return to his first love: Songwriting. </span></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:AppleSystemUIFont\"><span style=\"color:#353535\">Jacobs would return to Vancouver Island and begin his career as a solo original folk musician, all while completing a diploma in Jazz performance at VIU. In 2017, Jacobs released his first album, A 12 track LP entitled &ldquo;Sleepless Dreams&rdquo;. Drawing upon his Indie-Folk influences, the album featured lyrically diverse original songs about the life and experiences of a travelling musician. Most recently he has been performing and promoting the album daily, and has now sold over 2000 copies. The single from the album &ldquo;Indiana&rdquo;, was spun 47 times in it&rsquo;s first week of being played on Vancouver radio. Jacobs is now ready for more,&nbsp;and plans to begin recording an even stronger follow-up album in the winter of 2018.</span></span></p>", "node_id": 15979}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-123.120738, 49.282729]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"type": "organization", "name": "grunt gallery", "details": "<h4><strong>Vision &amp; Mandate</strong></h4><p>grunt gallery was founded in 1984 in Vancouver, BC with the vision to become an internationally renowned artist-run centre and further the practice of contemporary art.

Andy has also had the honour of being seated with the \u2018Na\u0331mg\u0331is T\u0313sit\u0313sa\u0331\u0142'walag\u0331a\u0331me' name of \u1e34\u0313wa\u0331mxa\u0331laga\u0331lis I'nis. Influenced heavily by his grandmother, he has always been driven to uphold the traditions of both the K\u2019\u00f3moks and Kwakwa\u0331ka\u0331'wakw First Nations. In this regard, Andy has pursued avenues where he can sing traditional songs and perform ceremonial dances at potlatches and in a number of different dance groups, most notably the <a href=\"http://www.lelaladancers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Le-La-La Dancers,</a> the<a href=\"http://gwawinadancers.org/\" target=\"_blank\"> Gwa'wina Dancers</a> and the K\u2019umugwe Dancers.</p><p>Pursuing other areas of traditional culture has also led Andy to complete a Master\u2019s degree in anthropology. Because the K\u2019\u00f3moks First Nation lies on the border between the larger Salish and Kwakwa\u0331ka\u0331'wakw realms, his thesis focused on notions and expressions of contemporary Comox identity. His work in anthropology provided him with a background in linguistics which subsequently inspired him to create a company, Copper Canoe, Inc, that specialized in the creation of Aboriginal language media.</p><p>Andy feels that his artwork stands on par with these other accomplishments. Although he began drawing Northwest Coast art at an early age, Andy's first serious attempt wasn\u2019t until 1990 when he started designing and painting chilkat-style blankets for use in potlatch dancing. From these early self-taught lessons, he has tried to follow in the footsteps of his Kwakwa\u0331ka\u0331'wakw relatives in creating bold and unique representations that remain rooted in the age-old traditions of his ancestors. The ability to create and print most of his own work has allowed Andy to explore and express his ancestral artwork in a number of contemporary ways.</p><p>Please feel free to browse my website: <a href=\"http://www.andyeverson.com\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.andyeverson.com</a>&nbsp; including galleries&nbsp;http://www.andyeverson.com/2014/2014.html</p><p>T-shirts and hoodies (Idle&nbsp;No More, Star Wars themed) are available through <a href=\"https://totemdesignhouse.ca/collections/andy-everson-collection\" target=\"_blank\">https://totemdesignhouse.ca</a></p><p>Gilakasla</p>", "node_id": 15997}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-124.928266, 49.673513]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"type": "organization", "name": "Skwach\u00e0ys Aboriginal Fair Trade Gallery", "details": "<p>Skwach\u00e0ys (pronounced skwatch-eyes) Lodge and Residence at 31 West Pender Street in Vancouver houses a fair trade gallery, boutique hotel and an urban Aboriginal artist residence.</p><p>At street level, the Urban Aboriginal Fair Trade Gallery showcases Aboriginal artistic and cultural work.</p><p>In the official naming and ceremonial blessing, Chief Ian Campbell of the Squamish Nation explained how Skwach\u00e0ys is a traditional reference to this area of Vancouver as a place of transformation.

In the twentieth century, modern civilization lost its connection with nature; the good news is that slowly we are trying to make a real connection again based on respect and appreciation. My Musqueam ancestors had many traditional sites in Richmond where they went to harvest food, present day Terra Nova Rural Park is one of those areas. Coast Salish people have carved stone for thousands of years, using traditional hand tools. Modern tools however, make this task much less complicated. I chose to use this traditional medium to honor people of the past, present, and future. From early on, I have learned the teachings of Coast Salish art. I chose to create a raven design because to my people he is known to be a crafty bird. Raven is a shape changer; he can take many forms. He is also a hero; he is brave. The land that Terra Nova Park encompasses has also seen many transformations, especially in the last two hundred years.

Travelling over 6000 kilometres from Vancouver to Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City, Montreal and Halifax, Norine absorbed the ever changing vast and beautiful panoramas&nbsp;from the Rocky Mountains to endless prairie sunsets, boreal forests and the Atlantic ocean. &nbsp;With no wifi and time to reflect on&nbsp;nature and the paradoxes of life,&nbsp;Norine met and communed with the diversity of fellow sojourners from all over Canada and around the world. Following the tour, as a Musician in Residence at Banff Centre for the Arts and Creativity, Norine wrote most of these compelling songs in her studio facing Sleeping Buffalo Mountain. So climb aboard, sit back and close your eyes let the rhythm of the train soothe and inspire while conjuring up feelings of nostalgia and dreams. &nbsp;The multi talented and Juno nominated Adam Popowitz produced this album and also plays bass and lead guitar on the recordings. Adam produced Gone To The Spirits the album behind Norine's nomination for this year's Western Canadian Music Awards.

At times miraculously taking the \"Blues\" to new heights . A relentless live performer, who is always true to herself and to those that embrace her work, Braun rides the crest of the wave of non-commercial stylists, delivering grit and sensitivity in one deep breath. Often compared to some of music's groundbreaking pioneers, Norine Braun is a unique gem, a diamond in the rough blossoming into a synergistic melting pot, that can only be defined as her own.&nbsp;</p><p>Norine Braun thrives on live performance and connecting with audiences worldwide. From New York City to Quebec City to Tokyo and beyond, Braun has performed at the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympic Games, at theatres, festivals, coffeehouses, casinos and clubs. Her appearances on the main stages of numerous festivals including the Vancouver Pride festival and an appearance on Breakfast Television have established her presence and grown her fan base.</p><p>Devotedly universal in her lyrical content and accessible to listeners who hold her words close to their heart, such is the norm for this seasoned songsmith.
